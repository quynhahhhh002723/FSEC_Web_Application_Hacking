SQL INJECTION
## What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a form of injection attack enabling the execution of harmful SQL commands. These commands manipulate a database server connected to a web application. Exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities allows attackers to circumvent security protocols of an application. They can bypass authentication and authorization of a web page or web application, accessing the entirety of the SQL database. Additionally, SQL Injection can be utilized to insert, alter, or delete data, resulting in persistent modifications to the application's content or functionality. Such attacks may also lead to a denial of service or compromise of the underlying server or other backend systems.
